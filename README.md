# huffman-encoding

This project generates a Huffman encoding based on frequency data in JSON form. It also converts a basic Huffman encoding dictionary to canonical form.

## huffman.coffee

Reads a JSON frequency map from stdin and outputs a basic Huffman encoding map in JSON format to stdout.

## canonical.coffee

Reads a JSON Huffman encoding map from stdin and outputs the canonical form in JSON to stdout.
